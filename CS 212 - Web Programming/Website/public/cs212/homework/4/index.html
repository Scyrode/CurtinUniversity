                        <h3>Whadjuk Boodjar People</h3>

                        <p>Whadjuk Boodjar people are the indigenous people of the Swan River plains in what is today called
                            Western Australia. It encompasses the areas of Perth, Fremantle and Joondalup, Armadale, Toodyay,
                            Wundowie, Bullsbrook, and Chidlow. The Whadjuk Boodjar people were the sacred keepers and
                            regulators of the Swan River, which brought fish that was hunted by the Whadjuk Boodjar people.
                            They took care of the Swan River plains for tens of thousands of years and are still proud of their
                            traditional way of life. They regulated which tribes would have access to the river according to
                            extended family size and reputation, as well as existence of sacred Whadjuk Boodjar land in the
                            territory of the requesting family. (Noongarculture, 2021)

                        <p>
                            The Whadjuk Boodjar people enjoyed a peaceful hunter-gatherer lifestyle where they would spear
            fish out of the Swan River using <i>gidjees</i>, which are traditional Whadjuk Boodjar spears. They would
            also hunt Kangaroos which they would skin and make coats, bags, and rugs to sit on. The Whadjuk
            Boodjar people would also furry animals such as possums, which they would their skin to make
            <i>bookas</i>, which are children’s clothes. The Whadjuk Boodjar were very content with their way of
            living and till today are proud of their heritage, their ancestors, and their traditional way of life.

                        <p>
                            The Hopi people Tribe is in north-eastern Arizona and have enjoyed this land for more than 2,000
            years. Their land encompasses parts of Coconino and Navajo counties and is 1.5 million acres wide,
            housing 12 villages on three mesas. According to Hopi legend, their tribe originally migrated to their
            current reserved land through South America, Central America, and Mexico. (Hopi Tribe | Inter
            Tribal Council of Arizona, 2021)

                        <p>
                            The Hopi people remain to this day a very religious and culturally proud people that celebrate ethics
            of peace and goodwill. Despite the influences of the outside world, the Hopi People have preserved
            their language, culture, and religion. They have maintained their sacred covenant with Maasaw, the
            ancient caretaker of the earth to tread their land as peaceful farmers and respectfully use its
            resources. (Welcome to the Hopi Tribe - The Hopi Tribe, 2021)

                    <h1>Addendum</h1>
                    <h2>Font Choices</h2>
                    <p>
                        Two font families were used in the essay: “Ephesis” and “Georgia”. Ephesis is a cursive font family that was used for headings. Since the essay discusses and honours the aboriginal peoples in America and Australia, the cursive font family Ephesis was chosen to signify that this document discusses land and heritage. Georgia is a serif font family that was used to style paragraphs. Serif fonts are ideal for paragraphs due to their letter clarity and separation.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Size of Headings and Paragraphs</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            &lt;H1&gt; headings are the largest in the document, with their font-size equal to 50px. They were made extra-large to distinguish them as the title of a new article in the webpage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;H2&gt; headings are the second largest text in the document, with their font-size equal to 30px. &lt;H2&gt; signify the first level of headings inside an article and so they are the largest text inside of an article (except for &lt;H1&gt;).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            “subtitle” classes, which are subtitles for the article’s title are given a font-size of 25px. They were made smaller than &lt;H2&gt; to distinguish them from the article’s main headings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;H3&gt; headings have a font-size of 20px. They were made slightly larger than paragraph text, to distinguish them from both parent headings (i.e.: &lt;H2&gt;) and paragraphs.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Colour Choices</h2>
                    <p>
                        The background-color of the &lt;Body&gt; of the HTML document was set to hsl(200, 100%, 50%). This results in a cyan-ish colour of full saturation and middle lightness. The background-color of the “centrePage” class (which describes the centred articles in the HTML document) was set to hsl(40, 100%, 40%). This results in a brownish colour of full saturation and a slightly dark lightness. These two colours were chosen as they are common shades used in traditional drawings made by many aboriginal peoples, as they are shades that closely resemble water-blue and tree-trunk-brown. Furthermore, the article titles were given a “background-color” of “antiquewhite”, to further highlight the start of a new article.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Paddings, Margins and Borders</h2>
                    <p>
                        The “centrePage” class is a class intended to centre the articles inside of this HTML document. To centre the articles in this HTML document, the “max-width” property was set to “960px”, a width commonly used for webpages, and the “margin” property was set to “auto”. Setting the margin property to “auto” means that the margins will adjust to ensure that the “max-width” of the element is met and that the margins on opposite sides are equal. Then a solid black border was placed around the entire element of size 32px. Furthermore, a padding of 16 was used to separate the contents of the articles inside the “centrePage” class from the border of the element.
                        Article titles and subtitles were given a margin of 8px, to separate them from each other and from the rest of the article (headings, paragraphs, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <h2>HTML Abuse</h2>
                    <p>
                        “&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;” used in subtitle to differentiate it visually from the rest of the body text. This was replaced with the class “subtitle”, which used the same font as the title and headings, but made slightly smaller than &lt;H2&gt;s and their “font-weight” was set to “bold”.
