                    <h3>Whadjuk Boodjar People</h3>

                    <p>Whadjuk Boodjar people are the indigenous people of the Swan River plains in what is today called
                        Western Australia. It encompasses the areas of Perth, Fremantle and Joondalup, Armadale, Toodyay,
                        Wundowie, Bullsbrook, and Chidlow. The Whadjuk Boodjar people were the sacred keepers and
                        regulators of the Swan River, which brought fish that was hunted by the Whadjuk Boodjar people.
                        They took care of the Swan River plains for tens of thousands of years and are still proud of their
                        traditional way of life. They regulated which tribes would have access to the river according to
                        extended family size and reputation, as well as existence of sacred Whadjuk Boodjar land in the
                        territory of the requesting family. (Noongarculture, 2021)

                        The Whadjuk Boodjar people enjoyed a peaceful hunter-gatherer lifestyle where they would spear
        fish out of the Swan River using <i>gidjees</i>, which are traditional Whadjuk Boodjar spears. They would
        also hunt Kangaroos which they would skin and make coats, bags, and rugs to sit on. The Whadjuk
        Boodjar people would also furry animals such as possums, which they would their skin to make
        <i>bookas</i>, which are children’s clothes. The Whadjuk Boodjar were very content with their way of
        living and till today are proud of their heritage, their ancestors, and their traditional way of life.

                        The Hopi people Tribe is in north-eastern Arizona and have enjoyed this land for more than 2,000
        years. Their land encompasses parts of Coconino and Navajo counties and is 1.5 million acres wide,
        housing 12 villages on three mesas. According to Hopi legend, their tribe originally migrated to their
        current reserved land through South America, Central America, and Mexico. (Hopi Tribe | Inter
        Tribal Council of Arizona, 2021)

                    <p>
                        The Hopi people remain to this day a very religious and culturally proud people that celebrate ethics
        of peace and goodwill. Despite the influences of the outside world, the Hopi People have preserved
        their language, culture, and religion. They have maintained their sacred covenant with Maasaw, the
        ancient caretaker of the earth to tread their land as peaceful farmers and respectfully use its
        resources. (Welcome to the Hopi Tribe - The Hopi Tribe, 2021)

                <h1>Addendum</h1>
                <p>
                    Below are all the tags used to translate the paper <i>The Land You Live On</i> by Ahmad Allahham to a HTML document with correct formatting:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;html&gt;</strong>: Tag that encapsulates all the html code to signify that everything inside this tag is “html code”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong>: Section that defines the meta information carried with the html web page, such as the page title
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong>: Used to define the HTML page title in the browser tab
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong>: Used to define everything that will be presented to the user on this HTML page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong>: Used as the paper is a self-contained paper
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>: Used once in the document for the paper’s title (or as in this case, if the entire page is broken down into multiple sections – Paper + Addendum – then each section can have a &lt;h1&gt; heading inside it)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</strong>: Used for Main header subtitle. While it is often recommended to use &lt;h3&gt; or &lt;h2&gt; for subheadings, using it here would result in the subtitle “Written by Ahmad Allahham” to be displayed in a table of contents should the HTML page have one, which is incorrect. Therefore, I opted to used a paragraph tag ‘&lt;p&gt;’ followed by a ‘&lt;strong&gt;’ tag, to differentiate it from regular text by making it <strong>bold</strong> while not presenting it as a header in the HTML hierarchy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;h2&gt;</strong>: Used for section headings (highest level aside from the paper’s title)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;h3&gt;</strong>: Used for subheadings
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>: Used for paragraph text. Each paragraph is wrapped in its own ‘&lt;p&gt;’ tag to separate the paragraphs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;i&gt;</strong>: Used to make text <i>italic</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;ol&gt;</strong>: Used to create an ordered list (i.e: numbered list)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>: Used to signify a list item
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&amp;lt;</strong>: To display a ‘&lt;’ character in html (especially if followed inside the same tag with ‘&gt;’, you must use the ASCII representation of that symbol; in this case, the ASCII equivalent of ‘&lt;’ is &amp;lt;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&amp;gt;</strong>: ASCII equivalent of ‘&gt;’ symbol
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>&lt;a href=””&gt;</strong>: Anchor tag used to transform text into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">Hyperlink</a>
                    </li>
