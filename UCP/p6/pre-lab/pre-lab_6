Q1)
a) "---23  --- +46"
b) "x= 1.230, y=216.00"

Q2)
a) scanf("%s %s", &wordOne, &wordTwo);
b) scanf("%d:%d:%d %s", &hours, &minutes, &seconds, &ampm);
c) scanf("N%d° %d\' %f.1\" W%d° 10\' %.1f\"");

Q3)
a)
use a while loop with that checks if the int read is equal to EOF.
use a fscanf() to read from the file with the format of:
fscanf(f, "%d ", array[i]);
Increment i at the each iteration of the while loop

b)
fscanf outputs the number of input items successfully matched 
and assigned
fgets returns the string on success

d) I would use fgets() to read the signed integer then check
the first char to see if its + or -. Convert the remaining String
to int and then using an if/else statement, multiply the int by '-'
if the first char is '-'

e) same process then convert the remaining String to float and then
using an if/else statement, multiply the int by '-' if the first
char is '-'
